### ZMESH - forked from [YADR] (https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles.git)

* ZMESH has following changes from YADR:
_ `neovim` instead `vim`_
_ `vim-plug` instead `Vundle`_

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git4sroy/zmesh/master/install.sh`"
```

* ZMESH will automatically install all of its subcomponents. If you want to be asked
about each one, use:

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git4sroy/zmesh/master/install.sh`" -s ask
```
