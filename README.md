**Still BETA Stage**_

### ZMESH - forked from YADR

* ZMESH is equiped with `neovim`, instead of vim and instead of `Vundle` uses `vim-plug`:

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git4sroy/zmesh/master/install.sh`"
```

* ZMESH will automatically install all of its subcomponents. If you want to be asked
about each one, use:

```bash
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git4sroy/zmesh/master/install.sh`" -s ask
```
